                    assigned or delegated by Seller; nor may all or substantially all of this Subcontract be further
                    subcontracted by Seller without the prior written consent of Buyer. Lack of consent shall not be
                    deemed as a waiver or otherwise relieve Seller of its obligations to comply fully with the
                    requirements hereof.
                    Notwithstanding the above, seller may, without Buyer’s consent, assign moneys due or to become due
                    hereunder provided Buyer continues to have the right to exercise any and all of its rights
                    hereunder, settle any and all claims arising out of, and enter into amendments to the Subcontract
                    without notice to or consent of the assignee. Buyer shall be given prompt notice of any assignment.
                    Amounts so assigned shall continue to be subject to any of Buyer’s rights to set-off or recoupment
                    under this Subcontract or at law.
                    Buyer may assign this Subcontract to any successor in interest.
